This plot shows the percentage of total variance in the data explained by each principal component. Additionally, cumulative variance - the sum of the percentage variance contributions from the first principal component up to a given component - can be displayed.

The cumulative variance threshold determines which principal components are shown: only those for which the cumulative variance explained remains below this threshold will be visible.

You can also specify the maximum number of principal components to display on the plot.

This table shows the ratios of missing values in each metabolite.

If the data is not grouped, the ratios represent the proportion of each missing value type within the total missing values for each metabolite. The sum of these proportions equals the total missing ratio for that metabolite.

If a grouping column was specified, the ratios indicate the proportion of missing values within each group level.

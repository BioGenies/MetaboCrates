This plot shows the percentage of total variance in the sample explained by each principal component. Additionally, cumulative variance - the sum of the percentage variance contributions from the first principal component up to a given component - can be displayed.

The cumulative variance threshold determines which principal components are shown. All components for which the cumulative variance remains below the threshold are included, along with one additional component that brings the cumulative variance just above the threshold (if applicable).

You can also specify the maximum number of principal components to display on the plot.

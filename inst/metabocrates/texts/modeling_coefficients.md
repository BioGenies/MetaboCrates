This table lists coefficients estimates for the fitted models. If the full model was fitted, the following columns are included:

* std.error - standard error of the coefficients estimate,
* statistic - Wald's test statistic,
* p.value - two-sided $p$-value corresponding to the Wald's test statistic.

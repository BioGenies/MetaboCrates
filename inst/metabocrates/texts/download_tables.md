In this xlsx file you will find:

* initial metabolomics matrix,
* LOD table,
* counts of missing values of each type,
* ratios of missing values of each type across metabolites,
* percentage of missing values in each group level across metabolites (if a group was specified),
* names of metabolites found in the data,
* counts of each sample type in the data,
* metabolomics matrix after imputation,
* coefficient of variation (CV) values calculated for each metabolite and QC type appearing in the data more than once.

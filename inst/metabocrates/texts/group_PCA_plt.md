PCA scatter plot display sample clustering, with colors indicating group level.


Biplot shows loadings, illustrating how each metabolite contributes to the principal components and highlighting metabolites that capture similar information.

Threshold indicates the absolute minimum correlation between a metabolite and any of the first two components, required for this
metabolite to be included on the biplot.

Up to 10 metabolites with the highest correlations with the first or second component are labeled.

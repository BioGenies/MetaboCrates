These plots show the ratio of missing values in the data for each metabolite.

Joint ratios represent the overall proportion of missing values, regardless of type.

The barplot including missing values types additionally shows the proportion of each type within the total missing values for each metabolite.

If a group is selected, a plot of its levels is shown, indicating the percentage of missing values in each group level.

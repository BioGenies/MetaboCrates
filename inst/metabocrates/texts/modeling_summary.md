This table summarizes the fitted logistic models. If the number of observations used is smaller than the number of independent variables, only the penalized model is built. It includes:

* null.deviance - devaince of the intercept-only (null) model,
* df.null - degrees of freedom for the null model,
* nobs - number of observations used,
* logLik - the log-likelihood of the model,
* AIC - Akaike's Information Criterion,
* BIC - Bayesian Information Criterion.
